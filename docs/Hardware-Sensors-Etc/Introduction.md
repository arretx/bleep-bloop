Most of the hardware that we use in our home's automation system fall into the category of the Internet of Things, and are relatively raw, meaning they aren't packaged in a fancy box with a fancy logo and a fancy enclosure.  Most of this stuff is just circuit boards and chips and capacitors and power supplies.  How those are put together is up to you.

# Overpriced Gadgets Flooding the Industry

In my experience, I've found that most companies who package and market home-automation systems, hubs, and devices, charge exponentially more than what the device is actually worth.  To top it off, in order to use their devices, you have to download their app, connect to their cloud service, and give some sort of information to them.  That information is used to figure out how to stimulate _you_ to give _more_ money to them by purchasing products that they market to you.

There are too many middle men in the supply chain.

I don't like that.  I want to design and build my own systems and have complete control over the flow of information inside of that infrastructure.  I want to source my electronics on my terms, and pay a fair price.  The beautiful part about computers in this day and age is that a multitude of tasks can be accomplished by a single micro-processor that costs less than $10.00.

# Device Configurations

Device Configurations contains a list of all of the hardware that I use in my home automation setup, including links to the wiring diagrams I've created using [Draw.io](https://draw.io), and accompanying 3D models for enclosures and accessories used in conjunction with these devices.

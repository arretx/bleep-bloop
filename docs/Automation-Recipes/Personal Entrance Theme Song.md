## **Goal**

To automatically play a personal audio clip when a specific person arrives. 

!!! note
    I originally started this project thinking that I could simply mix and match some popular components to create a DIY solution. I spent quite a bit of time designing and 3D Printing enclosures, wiring and soldering, and generally banging my head against the wall.  The source of the frustration was the RC522 reader, which just is _not_ powerful enough to reliably read keyfobs and keycards.  So, I ditched the the 100% DIY direction and bought the official RFID Relay Board and a Wiegand reader.  Problem solved.

## **Hardware Ingredients**

This one is pretty simple.

## **Software**

- HASS.io (Home Assistant)
- Volumio
- NodeRED HASS.io Add-on

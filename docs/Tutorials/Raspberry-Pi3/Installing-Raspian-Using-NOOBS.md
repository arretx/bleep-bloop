## Steps

*Do These Steps: Beer Optional*

1. Get a copy of the [most recent installation image](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/).
2. Get a 32GB MINI SD Card.
3. Format that card using MS-DOS FAT mode.
4. Unzip the file you downloaded and copy everything to the root of the memory card.
5. Eject the card and install it in your Raspberry Pi3.
6. Power up the Pi3.
7. At the NOOBS startup prompt, select the Raspian Full option then click the Install button on the toolbar.
8. Confirm the warning by clicking Yes.
9. Drink beer.  (1:51PM Mountain Time)
10. Incidentally, during the install, I noticed that the Language selection at the bottom of the screen was set to UK, so I switched it, because... 'Murica.
11. 2:11 PM.  OS installed successfully.  So that's about 20 minutes.  Now let's see what happens when it boots.
12. Despite changing the language during install, a `Set Country` prompt is asking me to set the locale after booting.
13. Location is set.  'Cause...ya know, 'Murica.
14. Password...hmm....clickity clackity.  Done.
15. Setup screen.  Strange black border exists...so...check!
16. WIFI Network found and Password entered...and connected!
17. Update software check starts.  Some sort of error checking for updates.  *yawn*  *ignore*.
18. Setup complete!  Restart.

So, that was easy.

But why is my initial desktop background a picture of some sort of Chinese landscape?

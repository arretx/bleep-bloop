## My Setup

After going back and forth between solutions, I settled on running Home Assistant in a Virtual Machine on an Unraid host.

### Hardware

* Custom Server rack mount system with 24TB storage and 32GB Ram
* ZWave Z-Stick Gen 5 attached to one of the server USB ports.
* Various Sonoff and Zwave devices, as well as a few Wemos D1 Mini boards and NodeMCU1.0 boards.
* Unifi Dream Machine Pro with a single 4TB Drive to capture all Protect footage.
* Unifi PoE 8 Port Switch
* Unifi 24-Port Switch
* Unifi 4 Port 10G switch
* Unifi Access Point (basic)

### Software

Everything is hosted by the Unraid server.

 * Home Assistant 2022.11.4 (as of 12/1/22)  I typically update as soon as there's a new version, so it's safe to say it's the latest version.
 * Supervisor 2022.11.2
 * Operating System 9.3
 * Front End - always latest

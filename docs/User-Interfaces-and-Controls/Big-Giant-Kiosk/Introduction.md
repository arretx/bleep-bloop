The Big Giant Kiosk is exactly what it sounds like, minus the touch control.  Until there are large flat screen panels that are touch compatible and aren't too expensive for an afternoon project, I'll simply create this setup with **Informational Purposes** in mind.

The Big Giant Kiosk is to be a display mounted somewhere in the house, or if this is successful, in multiple locations in the house to offer "at a glance" status indicators that are the most relevant to our daily lives.

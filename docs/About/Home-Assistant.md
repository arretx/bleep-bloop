## Home Assistant
We've chosen Home Assistant to be the brains of our home automation system.  You can read about it on the [Home Assistant website](https://home-assistant.io).  The reason for this is because we need privacy in a cloud-computing era, where our devices are held hostage by the requirements of the manufacturers that make them.  While it's possible to integrate your cloud based devices into your Home Assistant automation hub, being able to automate your house without being connected to the internet is the ultimate goal.  We don't need Google, or Amazon, or any other cloud service watching our every move all of the time, nor do we want to be held hostage by a third party manufacturer through planned obsolescense.

This site's focus is **all about [Home Assistant](https://home-assistant.io)** as it relates to home automation and integration of small electronics devices to solve every day problems and create every day awesomeness.

Home Assistant is the engine that drives all of our home's automations.  It's open source and free to use.  (Free is relative.  You'll invest some time into this if it interests you.)
